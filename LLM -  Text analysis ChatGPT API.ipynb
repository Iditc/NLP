      "== Background ==\n",
      "According to The Economist, improved algorithms, powerful computers, and an increase in digitized data have fueled a revolution in machine learning, with new techniques in the 2010s resulting in \"rapid improvements in tasks\" including manipulating language. Software models are trained to learn by using thousands or millions of examples in a \"structure ... loosely based on the neural architecture of the brain\". One architecture used in natural language processing (NLP) is a neural network based on a deep learning model that was first introduced in 2017—the transformer architecture. There are a number of NLP systems capable of processing, mining, organizing, connecting and contrasting textual input, as well as correctly answering questions.On June 11, 2018, OpenAI researchers and engineers posted their original paper introducing the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)—a type of generative large language model that is pre-trained with an enormous and diverse corpus of text via datasets, followed by discriminative fine-tuning to focus on a specific task. GPT models are transformer-based deep learning neural network architectures. Up to that point, the best-performing neural NLP models commonly employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually-labeled data, which made it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large language models.\n",
      "That first GPT model is known as \"GPT-1,\" and it was then followed by \"GPT-2\" in February 2019. GPT-2 was created as a direct scale-up of GPT-1, with both its parameter count and dataset size increased by a factor of 10. It had 1.5 billion parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages.In February 2020, Microsoft introduced its Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), which was claimed to be the \"largest language model ever published at 17 billion parameters.\" It performed better than any other language model at a variety of tasks which included summarizing texts and answering questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Training and capabilities ==\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 28, 2020, an arXiv preprint by a group of 31 engineers and researchers at OpenAI described the achievement and development of GPT-3, a third-generation \"state-of-the-art language model\". The team increased the capacity of GPT-3 by over two orders of magnitude from that of its predecessor, GPT-2, making GPT-3 the largest non-sparse language model to date.: 14  Because GPT-3 is structurally similar to its predecessors, its greater accuracy is attributed to its increased capacity and greater number of parameters. GPT-3's capacity is ten times larger than that of Microsoft's Turing NLG, the next largest NLP model known at the time.Lambdalabs estimated a hypothetical cost of around $4.6 million US dollars and 355 years to train GPT-3 on a single GPU in 2020, with lower actual training time by using more GPUs in parallel.\n",
      "Sixty percent of the weighted pre-training dataset for GPT-3 comes from a filtered version of Common Crawl consisting of 410 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens.: 9  Other sources are 19 billion tokens from WebText2 representing 22% of the weighted total, 12 billion tokens from Books1 representing 8%, 55 billion tokens from Books2 representing 8%, and 3 billion tokens from Wikipedia representing 3%.: 9  GPT-3 was trained on hundreds of billions of words and is also capable of coding in CSS, JSX, and Python, among others.\n",
      "Since GPT-3's training data was all-encompassing, it does not require further training for distinct language tasks. The training data contains occasional toxic language and GPT-3 occasionally generates toxic language as a result of mimicking its training data. A study from the University of Washington found that GPT-3 produced toxic language at a toxicity level comparable to the similar natural language processing models of GPT-2 and CTRL. OpenAI has implemented several strategies to limit the amount of toxic language generated by GPT-3. As a result, GPT-3 produced less toxic language compared to its predecessor model, GPT-1, although it produced both more generations and a higher toxicity of toxic language compared to CTRL Wiki, a language model trained entirely on Wikipedia data.On June 11, 2020, OpenAI announced that users could request access to its user-friendly GPT-3 API—a \"machine learning toolset\"—to help OpenAI \"explore the strengths and limits\" of this new technology. The invitation described how this API had a general-purpose \"text in, text out\" interface that can complete almost \"any English language task\", instead of the usual single use-case. According to one user, who had access to a private early release of the OpenAI GPT-3 API, GPT-3 was \"eerily good\" at writing \"amazingly coherent text\" with only a few simple prompts. In an initial experiment 80 US subjects were asked to judge if short ~200 word articles were written by humans or GPT-3. The participants judged correctly 52% of the time, doing only slightly better than random guessing.On November 18, 2021, OpenAI announced that enough safeguards had been implemented that access to its API would be unrestricted. OpenAI provided developers with a content moderation tool that helps them abide by OpenAI's content policy. On January 27, 2022, OpenAI announced that its newest GPT-3 language models (collectively referred to as InstructGPT) were now the default language model used on their API. According to OpenAI, InstructGPT produced content that was better aligned to user intentions by following instructions better, generating fewer made-up facts, and producing somewhat less toxic content.Because GPT-3 can \"generate news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans,\" GPT-3 has the \"potential to advance both the beneficial and harmful applications of language models.\": 34  In their May 28, 2020 paper, the researchers described in detail the potential \"harmful effects of GPT-3\" which include \"misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting\". The authors draw attention to these dangers to call for research on risk mitigation.: 34 GPT-3 is capable of performing zero-shot and few-shot learning (including one-shot).In June 2022, Almira Osmanovic Thunström wrote that GPT-3 was the primary author on an article on itself, that they had submitted it for publication, and that it had been pre-published while waiting for completion of its review.\n",

The model attempted to provide developers and users with an advanced natural language processing tool that can effectively retrieve and synthesize online information.To enable browsing capabilities, OpenAI implemented a new API that allows the GPT-3.5 with Browsing (ALPHA) model to access selected online resources during operation.

      "An article in the MIT Technology Review, co-written by Deep Learning critic Gary Marcus, stated that GPT-3's \"comprehension of the world is often seriously off, which means you can never really trust what it says.\" According to the authors, GPT-3 models relationships between words without having an understanding of the meaning behind each word.\n",

      "Nabla, a French start-up specializing in healthcare technology, tested GPT-3 as a medical chatbot, though OpenAI itself warned against such use. As expected, GPT-3 showed several limitations. For example, while testing GPT-3 responses about mental health issues, the AI advised a simulated patient to commit suicide.\n",
      "Noam Chomsky expressed his skepticism about GPT-3's scientific value: \"It's not a language model. It works just as well for impossible languages as for actual languages. It is therefore refuted, if intended as a language model, by normal scientific criteria. [...] Perhaps it's useful for some purpose, but it seems to tell us nothing about language or cognition generally.\"\n",

      "=== Criticism ===\n",
      "GPT-3's builder, OpenAI, was initially founded as a non-profit in 2015. In 2019, OpenAI broke from its usual open-source standards by not publicly releasing GPT-3's predecessor model, citing concerns that the model could facilitate the propagation of fake news. OpenAI eventually released a version of GPT-2 that was 8% of the original model's size. In the same year, OpenAI restructured to be a for-profit company. In 2020, Microsoft announced the company had exclusive licensing of GPT-3 for Microsoft's products and services following a multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI. The agreement permits OpenAI to offer a public-facing API such that users can send text to GPT-3 to receive the model's output, but only Microsoft will have access to GPT-3's source code.Large language models, such as GPT-3, have come under criticism from a few of Google's AI ethics researchers for the environmental impact of training and storing the models, detailed in a paper co-authored by Timnit Gebru and Emily M. Bender in 2021.The growing use of automated writing technologies based on GPT-3 and other language generators, has raised concerns regarding academic integrity and raised the stakes of how universities and schools will gauge what constitutes academic misconduct such as plagiarism.OpenAI's GPT series was built with data from the Common Crawl dataset, a conglomerate of copyrighted articles, internet posts, web pages, and books scraped from 60 million domains over a period of 12 years. TechCrunch reports this training data includes copyrighted material from the BBC, The New York Times, Reddit, the full text of online books, and more. In its response to a 2019 Request for Comments on Intellectual Property Protection for Artificial Intelligence Innovation from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), OpenAI argued that \"Under current law, training AI systems [such as its GPT models] constitutes fair use,\" but that \"given the lack of case law on point, OpenAI and other AI developers like us face substantial legal uncertainty and compliance costs.\"\n",

      "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models. It was initially released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API. GPT-4 is a transformer-based model, which uses pre-training on public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.\n",

It has been tested on standardized tests, such as the SAT, LSAT, and Uniform Bar Exam, and has been found to score in the 94th, 88th, and 90th percentiles, respectively. It has also been tested on medical problems and found to exceed the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points.\n",

GPT-4 is a multimodal model that can take images as input and has a context window of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens. It has been used for coding tasks, medical applications, and standardized tests. It has been criticized for its lack of transparency and potential biases. OpenAI has not released the technical details of GPT-4, and its cost of training was estimated to be over $100 million. It has been used in various applications, such as Duolingo, Khan Academy, and Stripe. There have been safety concerns, such as the model being able to \"hire\" a human worker on TaskRabbit. Despite this, OpenAI has demonstrated GPT-4 to Congress and it has been generally well-received.\n"
